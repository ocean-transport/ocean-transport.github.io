Andrew is a PhD student in the Department of [Earth & Environmental Sciences](https://eesc.columbia.edu/). He is funded by the National Science Foundation's [Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). His research interests are in (sub)mesoscale physical oceanography, and he is currently studying eddy stirring and turbulence using Argo float data. In addition to research, Andrew is interested in climate education and advocacy and is a Youth Advisory Board member at [The Wild Center](https://www.wildcenter.org/), a science and nature museum in the Adirondacks. He can be contacted at afagerheim@ldeo.columbia.edu.

## Postdocs

Manuel is a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University. He works on two complementary areas: (1) using machine learning techniques to combine observations from different instruments (e.g., gliders, Argo floats, etc.) with high-resolution numerical ocean models, to derive data-constrained estimates of high-resolution ocean state and (2) estimating macroturbulence relevant statistics from in-situ current observations, and using these to study long term trends in the oceanic eddy field. Manuel obtained his Ph.D. in Oceanography at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, where he later worked as Postdoctoral Scholar. Manuel enjoys cooking, reading books (science fiction, mental health, and magic realism), running, and watching football (soccer). He practices freediving regularly (or when the ocean conditions allow) and takes pictures of his favorite ocean critters. manuelgv@ldeo.columbia.edu

David is a researcher in the LOT group. His research interests are in using SWOT data to understand the physical dynamics of oceans at the coasts and continental shelves, as well as statistical and machine learning methods in climate physics more broadly. 

Formerly, David was the Legislative Director to New York State Assemblymember Ron Kim, as well as an Adjunct Professor of Economics at Adelphi University. He writes about the intersection of economics, foreign affairs, statecraft, and science at [Alphabet Agency](https://alphabetagency.substack.com/). Beyond his work, David enjoys collecting (and reading) used books.
