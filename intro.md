# LDEO Ocean Transport (LOT) Group

Welcome to the LDEO Ocean Transport Group Website!

The mission of the Ocean Transport Group is to advance scientific understanding of how stuff moves around the ocean and how this transport influences Earth’s large-scale climate and ecosystems.

We are located at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.
